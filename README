This is "yet another state machine" implementation.
It's supposed to work with Firefox, Chromium or node.js.

Just include StateMachine.js in your project.
There a simple use case in TestingStateMachine.js

There is still more tests to do.
For SubStateMachine working like a state you can use the data feild of State.
